We evaluated the reliability and validity of physiological signals (electrocardiogram, ECG; photoplethysmography, PPG; electrodermal activity, EDA) collected from two wearable devices (Movisens EcgMove4 and Empatica E4) in the lab (N = 67) and daily life (N = 20) among adults aged 18–64 with Mindware as the laboratory gold standard. Results revealed that both wearable devices’ valid data rates in daily life were lower than in the laboratory (Movisens ECG 82.94 vs. 93.10%, Empatica PPG 8.79 vs. 26.14%, and Empatica EDA 41.16 vs. 42.67%, respectively). The poor valid data rates of Empatica PPG signals in the laboratory could be partially attributed to participants' hand movements (r = – .27, p = .03). In laboratory settings, heart rate (HR) derived from both wearable devices exhibited higher concurrent validity than heart rate variability (HRV) metrics (ICCs 0.98–1.00 vs. 0.75–0.97). The number of skin conductance responses (SCRs) derived from Empatica showed higher concurrent validity than skin conductance level (SCL, ICCs 0.38 vs. 0.09). Movisens EcgMove4 provided more reliable and valid HRV measurements than Empatica E4 in both laboratory (split-half reliability: 0.95–0.99 vs. 0.85–0.98; concurrent validity: 0.95–1.00 vs. 0.75–0.98; valid data rate: 93.10 vs. 26.14%) and ambulatory settings (split-half reliability: 0.99–1.00 vs. 0.89–0.98; valid data rate: 82.94 vs. 8.79%). Although the reliability and validity of wearable devices are improving, findings suggest researchers should select devices that yield consistently robust and valid data for their measures of interest.","tags":null,"title":"From lab to life: Evaluating the reliability and validity of psychophysiological data from wearable devices in laboratory and ambulatory settings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jin Liu","Xin Hu","Xinke Shen, Sen Song, Dan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1703289600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1703289600,"objectID":"7dce0cf48b7befa3991852bbec2eadf8","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2023/electrophysiological-representations-of-multivariate-human-emotion-experience/","publishdate":"2023-12-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2023/electrophysiological-representations-of-multivariate-human-emotion-experience/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the fact that human daily emotions are co-occurring by nature, most neuroscience studies have primarily adopted a univariate approach to identify the neural representation of emotion (emotion experience within a single emotion category) without adequate consideration of the co-occurrence of different emotions (emotion experience across different emotion categories simultaneously). To investigate the neural representations of multivariate emotion experience, this study employed the inter-situation representational similarity analysis (RSA) method. Researchers used an EEG dataset of 78 participants who watched 28 video clips and rated their experience on eight emotion categories. The EEG-based electrophysiological representation was extracted as the power spectral density (PSD) feature per channel in the five frequency bands. The inter-situation RSA method revealed significant correlations between the multivariate emotion experience ratings and PSD features in the Alpha and Beta bands, primarily over the frontal and parietal-occipital brain regions. The study found the identified EEG representations to be reliable with sufficient situations and participants. Moreover, through a series of ablation analyses, the inter-situation RSA further demonstrated the stability and specificity of the EEG representations for multivariate emotion experience.

While positive emotions play a crucial role in various real-world applications, such as human-computer interactions, the state-of-the-art EEG datasets have primarily focused on negative emotions, with less consideration given to positive emotions. Meanwhile, these datasets usually have a relatively small sample size, limiting exploration of the important issue of cross-subject affective computing. The proposed Finer-grained Affective Computing EEG Dataset (FACED) aimed to address these issues by recording 32-channel EEG signals from 123 subjects. During the experiment, subjects watched 28 emotion-elicitation video clips covering nine emotion categories (amusement, inspiration, joy, tenderness; anger, fear, disgust, sadness, and neutral emotion), providing a fine-grained and balanced categorization on both the positive and negative sides of emotion. The validation results show that emotion categories can be effectively recognized based on EEG signals at both the intra-subject and the cross-subject levels. The FACED dataset is expected to contribute to developing EEG-based affective computing algorithms for real-world applications.","tags":null,"title":"A large finer-grained affective computing EEG dataset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chenhao Bao","Xin Hu","Dan Zhang, Zhao Lv, Jingjing Chen"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1687305600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1687305600,"objectID":"9463e6d0a0a980f1414cd9d24ee3baeb","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2023/predicting-moral-elevation-conveyed-in-danmaku-comments-using-eegs/","publishdate":"2023-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2023/predicting-moral-elevation-conveyed-in-danmaku-comments-using-eegs/","section":"publication","summary":"Moral elevation, the emotion that arises when individuals observe others’ moral behaviors, plays an important role in determining moral behaviors in real life. While recent research has demonstrated the potential to decode basic emotions with brain signals, there has been limited exploration of affective computing for moral elevation, an emotion related to social cognition. To address this gap, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 23 participants while they viewed videos that were expected to elicit moral elevation. More than 30,000 danmaku comments were extracted as a crowdsourcing tagging method to label moral elevation continuously at a 1-s temporal resolution. Then, by employing power spectra features and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized regression analyses, we achieved a promising prediction performance for moral elevation (prediction r = 0.44 ± 0.11). Our findings indicate that it is possible to decode moral elevation using EEG signals.

However, the inter-subject variability of emotion-related EEG signals still poses a great challenge for the practical applications of EEG-based emotion recognition. Inspired by recent neuroscience studies on inter-subject correlation, we proposed a Contrastive Learning method for Inter-Subject Alignment (CLISA) to tackle the cross-subject emotion recognition problem. Contrastive learning was employed to minimize the inter-subject differences by maximizing the similarity in EEG signkal representations across subjects when they received the same emotional stimuli in contrast to different ones. Specifically, a convolutional neural network was applied to learn inter-subject aligned spatiotemporal representations from EEG time series in contrastive learning. The aligned representations were subsequently used to extract differential entropy features for emotion classification. CLISA achieved state-of-the-art cross-subject emotion recognition performance on our THU-EP dataset with 80 subjects and the publicly available SEED dataset with 15 subjects. It could generalize to unseen subjects or unseen emotional stimuli in testing. Furthermore, the spatiotemporal representations learned by CLISA could provide insights into the neural mechanisms of human emotion processing.","tags":null,"title":"Contrastive learning of subject-invariant EEG representations for cross-subject emotion recognition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Hu","Fei Wang, Dan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1644883200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1644883200,"objectID":"95f38e3c09f4ea952dfc292c9f2454b4","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2022/similar-brains-blend-emotion-in-similar-ways-neural-representations-of-individual-difference-in-emotion-profiles/","publishdate":"2022-02-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2022/similar-brains-blend-emotion-in-similar-ways-neural-representations-of-individual-difference-in-emotion-profiles/","section":"publication","summary":"Our daily emotional experience is a complex construct that usually involves multiple emotions blended in a context-dependent manner. However, the co-occurring and context-dependent nature of human emotions was understated in previous studies when addressing the individual difference in emotional experiences. The present study proposed a situated and blended ‘profile’ perspective to characterize individualized emotional experiences. Eighty participants watched a series of emotional videos with their EEG recorded, and the individual differences in their emotion profiles were measured as the vector distances between their multidimensional emotion ratings for these video stimuli. This measure was found to be a reliable descriptor of individualized emotional experiences and could efficiently predict classical emotional complexity indices. More importantly, inter-subject representational analyses revealed that similar emotion profiles were associated with similar delta-band activities over the prefrontal and temporo-parietal regions and similar theta-band activities over the frontal regions. Furthermore, left- and right-lateralized temporo-parietal representations were observed for positive and negative emotion profiles, respectively.

The multi-channel event-related potentials elicited by these emotional words were used to train a sparse regression model for personality prediction. Results from a large test sample of 196 participants indicated that the personality scores derived from the proposed measure reached significant correlations with a commonly used questionnaire (r = .50, .60, .49, .55, and .49 for agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness, and extraversion, respectively). The EEG-based personality scores showed good external validity as well, capable of predicting behavioral indices and psychological adjustment similar to self-reported scores. Besides, the EEG-based scores were relatively stable across time, as reflected by the test-retest reliability of .5 ∼ .7 for the five personality traits within a cohort of 33 participants 19-78 days later. These evaluations suggest that the proposed measure can serve as a viable alternative to conventional personality questionnaires in practice.","tags":null,"title":"Quantitative personality predictions from a brief EEG recording","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Hugo Blox Builder is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Some preliminary neurophysiological evidences have been found with electroencephalography or autonomic nervous system measurements such as heart rate, skin conductance, etc. However, the brain’s hemodynamic responses to different positive emotions remain largely unknown. In the present study, the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) technique was employed. With this tool, we for the first time reported recognizable discrete positive emotions using fNIRS signals. Thirteen participants watched 30 emotional video clips to elicit 10 typical kinds of positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love), and their frontal neural activities were simultaneously recorded with a 24-channel fNIRS system. The multidimensional scaling analysis of participants’ subjective ratings on these 10 positive emotions revealed three distinct clusters, which could be interpreted as “playfulness” for amusement, joy, interest, “encouragement” for awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, pride, and “harmony” for love, serenity. Hemodynamic responses to these three positive emotion clusters showed distinct patterns, and HbO-based individual-level binary classifications between them achieved an averaged accuracy of 73.79 ± 11.49% (77.56 ± 7.39% for encouragement vs. harmony, 73.29 ± 11.87% for playfulness vs. harmony, 70.51 ± 13.96% for encouragement vs. harmony). Benefited from fNIRS’s high portability, low running cost and the relative robustness against motion and electrical artifacts, our findings provided support for implementing a more fine-grained emotion recognition system with subdivided positive emotion categories.","tags":null,"title":"fNIRS evidence for recognizably different positive emotions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xin Hu","Jingjing Chen, Fei Wang, Dan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551398400,"objectID":"c2a884bf83a267b2c5df8d3469ff627e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2019/ten-challenges-for-eeg-based-affective-computing/","publishdate":"2019-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2019/ten-challenges-for-eeg-based-affective-computing/","section":"publication","summary":"The emerging field of affective computing focuses on enhancing computers’ ability to understand and appropriately respond to people’s affective states in human-computer interactions, and has revealed significant potential for a wide spectrum of applications.

The present work reviewed ten theoretical and operational challenges for the existing affective computing researches from an interdisciplinary perspective of information technology, psychology, and neuroscience. On the theoretical side, we suggest that researchers should be well aware of the limitations of the commonly used emotion models, and be cautious about the widely accepted assumptions on EEG-emotion relationships as well as the transferability of findings based on different research paradigms. On the practical side, we propose several operational recommendations for the challenges about data collection, feature extraction, model implementation, online system design, as well as the potential ethical issues.

The current study aimed to fill this gap by exploring the behavioral and neural correlates of expertise for the most popular MOBA game, League of Legends (LOL). Three groups of LOL players with different expertise levels were recruited, including professional players, background-matched trainees, and age-matched students with no systematic LOL trainings. A series of behavioral tests and questionnaires was used to evaluate their general cognitive skills and their LOL-specific abilities were extracted from the neural activities (Electroencephalographs (EEG)s and Electrocardiographs (ECG)s) recorded during LOL matches. Using the behavioral features, both the students and the trainees could be significantly separated from the professional players (trainees vs. professional players, 61.11%; students vs. professional players, 66.67%), whereas the students and the trainees cannot be distinguished. Using the neural features, all three groups could be well separated with higher classification accuracies (students vs. trainees: 88.24%; trainees vs. professional players, 93.33%; students vs. professional players, 93.75%). The most contributing behavioral and neural indices were revealed as well, including multiple-object tracking capability, mental concentration, visuospatial attention ability, etc. The authors’ results for the first time showed the possibility of recognizing MOBA expertise using both behavioral and neural measurements and provided a framework for evaluation, selection, and training of professional MOBA players.","tags":null,"title":"What makes a champion: The behavioral and neural correlates of expertise in multiplayer online battle arena games","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yue Ding","Xin Hu","Zhenyi Xia, Yong-Jin Liu, Dan Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"\r","date":1529625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1529625600,"objectID":"aecf4170c265b0287ce8281d9756ae42","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/journal-article/2018/inter-brain-eeg-feature-extraction-and-analysis-for-continuous-implicit-emotion-tagging-during-video-watching/","publishdate":"2018-06-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal-article/2018/inter-brain-eeg-feature-extraction-and-analysis-for-continuous-implicit-emotion-tagging-during-video-watching/","section":"publication","summary":"How to efficiently tag the emotional experience of multimedia contents is an important and challenging problem in the field of affective computing. This paper presents an EEG-based real-time emotion tagging approach, by extracting inter-brain features from a group of participants when they watch the same emotional video clips. First, the continuous subjective reports on both the arousal and valence dimensions of emotion were obtained by employing a three-round behavioral rating paradigm. Second, the inter-brain features were systematically explored in both spectral and temporal domain. Finally, regression analyses were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of inter-brain amplitude and phase features. The inter-brain amplitude feature showed significantly better prediction performance than the inter-brain phase feature, as well as another two conventional features (spectral power and inter-subject correlation). By combining the four types of features, regression values (R2) were obtained for the prediction of arousal (0.61 + 0.01) and valence (0.70 + 0.01), corresponding to prediction errors of 1.01 + 0.02 and 0.78 + 0.02 (unit on 9-point scales), respectively.

In the present study, we explored the EEG correlates of ten different positive emotions (joy, gratitude, serenity, interest, hope, pride, amusement, inspiration, awe, and love). A group of 20 participants were invited to watch 30 short film clips with their EEGs simultaneously recorded. Distinct topographical patterns for different positive emotions were found for the correlation coefficients between the subjective ratings on the ten positive emotions per film clip and the corresponding EEG spectral powers in different frequency bands. Based on the similarities of the participants’ ratings on the ten positive emotions, these emotions were further clustered into three representative clusters, as ‘encouragement’ for awe, gratitude, hope, inspiration, pride, ‘playfulness’ for amusement, joy, interest, and ‘harmony’ for love, serenity. Using the EEG spectral powers as features, both the binary classification on the higher and lower ratings on these positive emotions and the binary classification between the three positive emotion clusters, achieved accuracies of approximately 80% and above.
