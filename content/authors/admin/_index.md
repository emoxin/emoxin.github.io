<div style="text-align: justify">I obtained my Ph.D. in Psychology from Tsinghua University. l am interested in affectiveneuroscience, affective disorders, and how to connect these two. Currently, l am undergoing postdoctoral training in Dr. Bylsma's lab, honing my skills in ambulatoryphysiological assessment to bridge the laboratory and real-life research findings.
<br>
I also have two cockatiels <em>(Lady Bo and Mr Hui)</em> who study human emotions in real-life settings.
