abstract: "To better understand the psychological and physiological basis of human emotion, increasing interest has been drawn towards ambulatory recordings of emotion-related data beyond the laboratories. By employing smartphones-based ambulatory assessment and wrist-worn physiological recording devices, the Daily Ambulatory Psychological and Physiological recording for Emotion Research (DAPPER) dataset provides momentary self-reports and physiological data of people’s emotional experiences in their daily life. The dataset consists of ambulatory psychological recordings from 142 participants and physiological recordings from 88 of them over five days. Both the experience sampling method (ESM) and the day reconstruction method (DRM) were employed to have a comprehensive description of the participants’ daily emotional experiences. Heart rate, galvanic skin response, and three-axis acceleration were recorded during the day time. By including multiple types of physiological and self-report data at a scale of five days with 100+ participants, the present dataset is expected to promote emotion researches in real-life, daily settings."
