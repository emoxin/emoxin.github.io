abstract: "The emerging field of affective computing focuses on enhancing computers’ ability to understand and appropriately respond to people’s affective states in human-computer interactions, and has revealed significant potential for a wide spectrum of applications. Recently, the electroencephalography (EEG) based affective computing has gained increasing interest for its good balance between mechanistic exploration and real-world practical application. The present work reviewed ten theoretical and operational challenges for the existing affective computing researches from an interdisciplinary perspective of information technology, psychology, and neuroscience. On the theoretical side, we suggest that researchers should be well aware of the limitations of the commonly used emotion models, and be cautious about the widely accepted assumptions on EEG-emotion relationships as well as the transferability of findings based on different research paradigms. On the practical side, we propose several operational recommendations for the challenges about data collection, feature extraction, model implementation, online system design, as well as the potential ethical issues. The present review is expected to contribute to an improved understanding of EEG-based affective computing and promote further applications."
