abstract: "Moral elevation, the emotion that arises when individuals observe others’ moral behaviors, plays an important role in determining moral behaviors in real life. While recent research has demonstrated the potential to decode basic emotions with brain signals, there has been limited exploration of affective computing for moral elevation, an emotion related to social cognition. To address this gap, we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals from 23 participants while they viewed videos that were expected to elicit moral elevation. More than 30,000 danmaku comments were extracted as a crowdsourcing tagging method to label moral elevation continuously at a 1-s temporal resolution. Then, by employing power spectra features and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regularized regression analyses, we achieved a promising prediction performance for moral elevation (prediction r = 0.44 ± 0.11). Our findings indicate that it is possible to decode moral elevation using EEG signals. Moreover, the small-sample neural data can predict the continuous moral elevation experience conveyed in danmaku comments from a large population."
